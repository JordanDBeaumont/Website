I'm currently completing my PhD in Nutrition at Leeds Trinity University, where I examine the effects of non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) techniques on reward-driven eating behaviours (e.g. food cravings, food consumption). I also teach across nutrition, sport and psychology modules at undergraduate and postgraduate level, and supervise masters dissertation students.
